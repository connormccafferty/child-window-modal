# Launch Asset Example

This repo is an example of how to use a child window to replicate standard web modal behavior. Show the modal by pressing the button, notice that an overlay is shown on the parent window to indicate it's inactive and also user movement / event propogation is disabled until the modal is closed.

### How to use this:

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/connormccafferty/child-window-modal.git`
- Install the dependencies: `cd child-window-modal` & `npm install`
- Start the live-server and launch the application on it's current version: `npm start`
